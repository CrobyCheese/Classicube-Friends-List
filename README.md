# Classicube-Friends-List
Very early verson of a classicube friends list
# Why make this? 
I thought classicube would be a lot more fun if you could join you're friends worlds. 
If they want to share worlds with you they can just add there world to their fork of this github
or maybe some day even be able to go on classicube.net/ and click friends list and be able to upload/download a world to 
play.
# Why no css?
I'm really bad with css, you can do it you're self.
# GO PLAY CLASSICUBE NOW
